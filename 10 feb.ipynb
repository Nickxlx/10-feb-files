    "Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode\n",
    "of file opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer--> In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. This function takes in two parameters: the first parameter is the file path, and the second parameter is the mode in which the file is to be opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 \"r\" mode: This mode is used to read a file. It is the default mode, so if no mode is specified, the file is opened in read mode. In this mode, the file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 \"w\" mode: This mode is used to write to a file. If the file already exists, its contents are truncated. If the file does not exist, a new file is created. In this mode, the file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 \"a\" mode: This mode is used to append to a file. If the file already exists, new data is written to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created. In this mode, the file pointer is placed at the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 \"x\" mode: This mode is used to create a new file and open it for writing. If the file already exists, a FileExistsError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 \"b\" mode: This mode is used to open a file in binary mode. This is used when reading or writing binary data such as images or audio files.\n",
    "\n",
    "6 \"t\" mode: This mode is used to open a file in text mode. This is used when reading or writing text data such as a .txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "7 \"+\" mode: This mode is used to open a file for both reading and writing. This is useful when you need to both read and write to the same file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also combine different modes by using them together. For example, \"rb\" mode is used to open a file in binary mode for reading."

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer--> In Python, the close() function is used to close an open file. It is important to close a file after you're done working with it, because  When you write to a file, the changes you make are typically stored in a buffer in memory. The close() function ensures that any changes in the buffer are written to the file before it is closed. If you don't close the file, any changes you made may be lost."
